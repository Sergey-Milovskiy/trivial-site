    <h1> Part A – Create Basic Website </h1>
    <p>Each student will create a website with several web pages that use HTML5, CSS3 and
        images. Students are expected to implement fully functional navigation between the pages.</p>
    <p>You will need to create a website to show case your abilities – an online portfolio of your
        work. The website should consist of several pages with properly implemented navigation
        between them. At a minimum, your website should consist of at least three web pages. You
        are encouraged to have more pages if doing so provides a better user experience.</p>
    <p>When designing and implementing the website, you need to keep the following
        requirements in mind:</p>
        <p><img src="images/cats.jpg" alt="Picture of cat"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Showcase your existing work and, if appropriate, provide narrative for it. Highlight
                your talents and abilities.</li> 
        <li>Project a professional image. Your audience is prospective employers, clients or
                recruitment agents.</li> 
        <li>Provide a method for interested parties to contact you.</li>
        <li>Your website should work well on a desktop computer with Firefox and Chrome.</li>
